# BANK_LOAN_ANALYTICS


# PROJECT OVERVIEW
The Bank Loan Portfolio Analysis project aims to leverage Excel queries and visualization tools to provide comprehensive insights into the bank's loan portfolio. By analyzing various loan metrics, the project seeks to enhance decision-making processes, mitigate risks, and optimize loan management strategies.

# SIGNIFICANCE 

Understanding the bank's loan portfolio is crucial for effective decision-making in banking institutions. Analyzing loan data helps in assessing the distribution of loans across different categories, evaluating loan performance metrics, identifying trends, and optimizing lending practices. This project enables stakeholders to make informed decisions related to loan management, risk mitigation, and portfolio optimization, ultimately contributing to the bank's overall financial health and performance.

# PROJECT ANALYSIS

In the analysis for the Bank Loan Portfolio project, data cleaning and transformation were initially conducted using excel tools. Following this, pivot tables were created to calculate key metrics like interest rates and loan application percentages. Interactive dashboards were then designed with a range of visualizations such as pie charts, bar graphs, line/area chats. Additionally, bookmarks and page navigations were implemented to enhance user experience, allowing for seamless navigation between different sections of the dashboard. Conditional formatting was also applied to highlight important insights, ensuring stakeholders could easily interpret loan portfolio data for informed decision-making and risk assessment.
